    "presentation" : "I am 20 years old and currently studying engineering in St Nazaire. I am sociable, dynamic, and have good understanding and listening skills. In addition, I am always willing to make suggestions. Being a practitioner of martial arts, these disciplines have instilled in me rigor, respect, and discipline. Since 2019, I have held the positions of vice president and trainer in a Canoe-Kayak association in Besn√©. This role involves preparing training sessions and ensuring their smooth execution, which has enhanced my ability to communicate effectively with young people and ensure their safety while engaging in leisure activities."
